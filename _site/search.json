Single-firm event studies are widely used in civil litigation, with billions of dollars in settlements hinging on the outcome of the exercise. We find that regularization (equivalently, penalized estimation) can yield noticeable improvements in both the variance of event-date abnormal returns and significance-test power. Thus we believe that there is a role for ML methods in event studies used in securities litigation. At the same time, we find that ML-induced performance improvements are smaller than those based on other good practices. Most important are (i) the use of a peer index based on returns for firms in similar industries (how this is computed appears to be less important than that some version be included), and (ii) for significance testing, using the SQ test proposed in Gelbach et al. (2013), because it is robust to the considerable non-normality present in abnormal returns."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nOne of the most contentious and long-standing debates in corporate governance is whether company founders and other insiders should be permitted to use multi-class stock structures with unequal votes to control their companies while seeking capital through a public listing. Stymied by the permissive attitudes of legislatures and regulators, institutional investors opposed to multi-class arrangements recently turned to a new potential source of regulation: benchmark equity index providers. At the behest of institutional investors, the three largest index providers recently changed the eligibility requirements for their benchmark equity indexes to exclude, limit or underweight companies with multi-class stock structures. Investors expected the prospect of exclusion from such indexes to discourage founders and directors from adopting dual-class stock structures in connection with their initial public offerings.\nWhile there is a voluminous financial literature on the effects of index inclusion and exclusion on stock prices, and legal scholars have recently explored the corporate governance implications of the exponential growth of passive index investing, focusing primarily on the incentives of index fund asset managers, neither the financial nor the legal literature have considered the corporate governance role and influence of the parties who write the rules for index investing: the index providers. We begin to fill this gap in the literature by assessing the efficacy of index providers as corporate governance arbiters through the rubric of their dual-class index exclusion decisions.\nWe start with the premise that the index exclusion sanction will not discourage dual-class listings unless it is sufficiently costly to outweigh the perceived benefits of founder control through a multi-class stock structure. We expect the index exclusion sanction will not be sufficiently costly for several reasons. First, it is difficult, if not impossible, to implement a sanction through the public capital markets. Second, the index inclusion effect on which the anticipated sanction is premised has effectively disappeared in recent years and may never have been a long-term source of lower capital costs. Third, despite the explosive growth of index investing in recent years, funds following stock indexes still hold a relatively modest percentage of the market capitalization of U.S. equities – around 12% according to BlackRock. Finally, the proliferation of index investing opportunities has weakened the market-moving influence of any one benchmark index.\nTo test the efficacy of the sanction, we conduct an event study of the S&P announcement that dual-class companies would henceforth be excluded from the S&P 1500 Composite Index and its components – the S&P 500, S&P 400 mid-cap and S&P 600 small-cap indices. Because S&P grandfathered dual-class companies currently in the index, we are able to compare movements in the stock prices of dual-class companies currently in the index with movements in the stock prices of dual-class companies not yet included in the index at the time of announcement. We do not observe any statistically significant abnormal returns in the stock prices of either included or excluded firms as a result of the S&P announcement, suggesting that exclusion is not expected to have a significant adverse cost of capital effect on firms that elect to list with a dual-class stock structures in the future and the sanction is ineffective. In the absence of an effective sanction, the exclusion of dual-class shares from benchmark equity indexes will not affect corporate governance choices. It may, however, have material adverse consequences for index investors and the index providers themselves."

    "text": "Abstract\nLawsuits brought pursuant to section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act depend on the reliability of a statistical tool called an event study to adjudicate issues of reliance, materiality, loss causation, and damages. Although judicial acceptance of the event study technique is pervasive, there has been little empirical analysis of the ability of event studies to produce reliable results when applied to a single company’s security.\nUsing data from the recent financial crisis, this Note demonstrates that the standard-model event study used in most court proceedings can lead to biased inferences sanctioned through the Daubert standard of admissibility for expert testimony. In particular, in the presence of broad market volatility, a base event study will cause too many returns to be identified as statistically significant. Even recently proposed variations of the event study model specifically designed to address violations of the statistical assumptions of an event study will not completely correct this bias.\nThis Note proposes two alternative forms of event studies that are capable of creating statistically reliable results and should be adopted by courts in instances where there is cause to believe that market volatility has increased. Over previous decades, the judiciary has steadily moved toward a reliance on empirics and expert testimony in overseeing complex civil cases. Yet there has been surprisingly little research accompanying this judicial deference on the ability of statistical evidence to produce the promised result. This Note calls into question whether this movement has been beneficial from a logical or empirical perspective, but it demonstrates that alternative techniques that can aid the finder of fact in resolving these disputes—regardless of market trends—may in fact exist."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper I explore the relationship between the rise of hedge fund activism and firm outcomes, using a study design that explicitly takes into account how activists pick their targets. Contrary to much prior work, I find no evidence that activism is associated with increased firm operating performance or significant long-term returns once comparing to firms based on their similarity to the targets. However, activism does increase firm payouts to shareholders and decreases investment, consistent with the argument of many critics of activism. I also find that firm-level employment declines significantly following a targeting event, and that the subset of firms that experience an increase in operating performance also engage in higher levels of tax avoidance. The deregulation of proxy access rules, wholesale de-staggering of corporate boards, and the rise in importance of proxy advisory firms who frequently recommend voting for activist proposals have made firms more susceptible to aggressive activism over the past three decades. The results in this paper, coupled with the rhetorical shift in focus from short-term profits to sustainable growth by large institutional investors, suggest a re-framing of the public debate over the benefits of shareholder activism."
